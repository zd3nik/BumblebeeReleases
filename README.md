Bumblebee
=========

By Shawn Chidester <zd3nik@gmail.com>

This is a UCI chess engine that uses the [Senjo UCI Adapter](https://github.com/zd3nik/SenjoUCIAdapter) and a hybrid move generator.  I call the move generator a hybrid because it is a combination of the "home-brew" bitboard move generation approach used in [Bitfoot](https://github.com/zd3nik/Bitfoot) and the pre-compiled array approach I used in my [aperft](https://github.com/zd3nik/aperft) project.

Bumblebee also uses new forms of search selection, as compared to the techniques I've typically used in my other engines such as [Clubfoot](https://github.com/zd3nik/Clubfoot), [Bitfoot](https://github.com/zd3nik/Bitfoot), [Clunk](https://github.com/zd3nik/Clunk), Hiroki (never released), Fibonacci (never released), etc.

At some point I may release the source code for Bumblebee.  But for the foreseeable it will remain private.
